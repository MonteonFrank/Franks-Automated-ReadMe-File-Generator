# Franks-Automated-ReadMe-File-Generator

<h1>ReadMe File Generator<h1>

<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>

<p>For this challenge, we had to create a ReadMe File generator using NodeJS. For this challenge, we had to use topics seen in class like the inquirer module from NodeJS to prompt the user with questions. Upon receiving the user's ansers, we will then use these to fill in the gaps of the ReadMe file. the questions we prompt the user are for Description, Installation, Usage, Contribution, License and links to where to contact the user and these were also added into a table of contents at the top</p> 
  
<p>For the license, we also had to obtain the badge and the description link to add to the ReadMe File </p>
 
<h2><strong>Programming Logic</strong></h2>
<p>As mentioned before, we had to use the inquierer module from NodeJS in the index.js file in order to prompt the questions to the user. Afterwards, the answers were stored in variables for us to access and print out in the Read Me File.</p>
  
<p>There is another file for the license which was partially provided where the license badge and link are obtained based on the users response (limited to 3 licenses for now) and was exported for us to use in the index.js file. </p>

<p>For rendering the ReadMe File, we used template literals with the answer variables to paste the users information into the ReadMe template and once completed it has the format desired with the answers from the user.</p>


<h2><strong>What did I learn?</strong></h2>
<p>For this challenge, I learned how to use NodeJS and some of its libraries and learned why its important. We can take advantage of using Node JS and its libraries to obtain information and then display it in the front end. </p>
